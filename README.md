# 🐠 ReefGuard: Cultural Firewall Against Climate Collapse

## 🌊 Overview

**ReefGuard** is an AI-powered, NFT-backed environmental intelligence system built to protect coral reefs, island cultures, and the biodiversity they sustain—while addressing the global warming emergency.
Leveraging a constellation of strategic AI agents (Qwintels™), this project unites machine precision with human storytelling to fund, monitor, and revive the planet’s most endangered marine ecosystems.

## 🎯 Hackathon Context

Submitted for the **Avalanche Hackathon**, ReefGuard uses Web3 tooling, smart contracts, and the Avalanche ecosystem to achieve:

- NFT minting & storytelling for indigenous and international artists.
- Smart contract-based fund routing for coral restoration.
- Reef analysis powered by responsible AI guidance.
- Global community engagement through blockchain transparency.

## 🔗 Live Demo

A short video walkthrough is available [here](#)  
(*or link to Loom/YouTube/demo repo when available*)

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Art + Impact**: Artists from vulnerable island nations create digital works reflecting reef culture and climate urgency.
2. **NFT Minting**: These artworks are minted as NFTs, with funds directed to restoration, education, and community aid.
3. **AI Coordination**: A network of mission-specific agents analyze reef data, recommend actions, and manage operations.
4. **Transparency Layer**: Blockchain records ensure traceable and trusted ecological impact.

## ⚙️ Smart Contract

- Language: Solidity
- Platform: Avalanche (C-Chain)
- Current Status: ✅ Logic Complete | 🟡 Testnet Deployment Pending
- Contract Address (to be added post-deployment): `0x...`
- Features:
  - NFT minting with royalty logic
  - Donation routing to climate causes
  - Metadata link to coral zones and artists

## 🧠 Intelligence Framework

ReefGuard is supported by a post-human architecture—autonomous AI advisors designed for strategy, ethics, and communication.

> Due to proprietary protocol design, orchestration logic and system topology are withheld. Inquiries under NDA may be directed to the founder.

Sample functions include:
- **Ethical AI governance**
- **Environmental analytics**
- **Narrative synthesis**
- **Legal/IP risk analysis**
