## 🌎 Strategic Expansion

ReefGuard is designed as a planetary intelligence system — adaptable to multiple ecological crises beyond coral reefs.

Future deployments include:
- ❄️ Glacial melt zone protection (Arctic, Andes, Himalayas)
- 🌵 Desertification reversal zones (Sahel, Australia, Gobi)
- 🌳 Rainforest preservation (Amazon, Congo Basin, Southeast Asia)
- 🏔️ Mountain ecosystem monitoring

Each deployment pairs local/global artists with AI agents (Qwintels™) to fund, monitor, and restore Earth’s endangered biomes.

We aim to integrate with:
- 🎨 Global art galleries
- 📣 Social impact influencers
- 🌐 Web3 sustainability coalitions

ReefGuard is not a tool. It’s an evolving intelligence — a cultural firewall against extinction.
